#Dataset¶
The dataset is stored in Kaggle under teh CC0: Public Domain License. It was generated by a distributed survey via Amazon Mechanical Turk between 03.12.2016-05.12.2016 and is organized in a long format.

There are some issues with bias and credibility:

From Kaggle, we were told that 30 users consented to the submission of their data. This dataset has up to 35 distinct user ids.
This is a small dataset that might not represent the general population. The dataset does not have any demographic information such as age, gender, and economic status.
The dataset was collected in 2016. It is outdated and does not acccurately reflect current trends.
The data was cleaned in Excel for duplicates, corrected formatting discrepancies, and then uploaded into BigQuery.

#Findings
There is no correlation between the average number of active minutes to the average time awake every night.
74% of users are active while only 6% are inactive.
37% of users have a sedentary lifestyle, 20% have low activity, 14% are active, 22% are somewhat active, and 5% are highly active.

#Recommendations
Gain more relevant data by conducting a survey of current users and other tracking app users to determine what they like and dislike in an app.
Try setting targeted movement reminders to encourage more activity, especially for those with low activity.
As this company is geared towards women, add a cycle tracker so women can track when they have their period.
Add an education section to help users understand the importance of physical activity and health.
